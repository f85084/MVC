    There are 2 categories of built-in templated helpers.
    -----------------------------
    4.1.
    Display Templates
    -----------------
    4.1.1.
    //@Html.DisplayFor(model => model.Name)
    The view must have strongly typed view Model.
    It can work with the complex type Model property.
    It is similar to @Html.DisplayTextFor(model => model.GameHolder)
    //@Html.DisplayTextFor(model => model.GameHolder)
    model.GameHolder will return a Gamer object.
    The Gamer class has [DisplayColumn("Name")] attribute,
    so it will display Gamer Name property value
    which is the full name of that gamer.
    -----------------
    4.1.2.
    //@Html.DisplayForModel()
    The view must have strongly typed view Model.
    It will display every property in view model
    except the properties with [ScaffoldColumn(false)] attribute.
    -----------------
    4.1.3.
    @Html.Display helper does not need strongly typed view Mode.
    //ViewData["GamerData"] = gamer;
    //return View();
    In the controller, we put the gamer object into ViewData["GamerData"]
    "GamerData" in this case is the key of ViewData.
    ViewData["GamerData"] contains that gamer object data,
    so we don't have to use a view model.
    //@Html.Display("GamerData")
    In the view, we use @Html.Display("GamerData")
    to retrieve the Gamer data from ViewData["GamerData"].
    It will display everything
    except the properties with [ScaffoldColumn(false)] attribute.
    -----------------------------
    4.2.
    Display Templatess
    -----------------
    4.2.1.
    //@Html.EditorFor(model => model.Name)
    The view must have strongly typed view Model.
    It will create a textbox for the property value input.
    -----------------
    4.2.2.
    //@Html.EditorForModel()
    The view must have strongly typed view Model.
    It will create textbox input for every property in view model
    except the properties with [ScaffoldColumn(false)] attribute.
    -----------------
    4.2.3.
    @Html.Editor helper does not need strongly typed view Mode.
    //ViewData["GamerData"] = gamer;
    //return View();
    In the controller, we put the gamer object into ViewData["GamerData"]
    "GamerData" in this case is the key of ViewData.
    ViewData["GamerData"] contains that gamer object data,
    so we don't have to use a view model.
    //@Html.Editor("GamerData")
    In the view, we use @Html.Editor("GamerData")
    to retrieve the Gamer data from ViewData["GamerData"].
    It will create textbox input for every properties in ViewData["GamerData"]
    except the properties with [ScaffoldColumn(false)] attribute.
    However, we pressed submit button and call the [HttpPost] action
    //public async Task<ActionResult>
    EditThree(int id, string name, string gender, string city, DateTime? dateOfBirth, string emailAddress, int? score, string profileUrl, int? gameMoney, int? teamId)
    OR
    //public async Task<ActionResult>
    EditThree(Gamer gamer)
    Both ways can not retrieve the data because it is not strongly typed.
    I don't suggest to use @Html.Editor helper
