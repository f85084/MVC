1.1.
When a request comes in,
it's trying to do a pattern match based on
all the templates it sees in these mapped routes.
A route is some instructions for
how to take a URI coming into a request
and map it to some code,
normally a controller.
In this case,
look at defaults parameter,
when user request http://localhost:PortNumber/
IIS Express will run   
HomeController Index action.
It will map to Controllers/HomeController.cs    
and   map to Index Method
1.2.
By convention in MVC.
All controllers will have Controller suffix.
This suffix is not required in the URL.
So, if you want to invoke Home controller,
you specify /Home and not /HomeController.

//routes.IgnoreRoute("{resource}.axd/{*pathInfo}");
2.1.
Reference:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9016650/what-is-routes-ignorerouteresource-axd-pathinfo
This line can handle the axd file request route,
E.g. trace.axd
.axd files don't exist physically.
ASP.NET uses URLs with .axd extensions
(ScriptResource.axd and WebResource.axd) internally,
and they are handled by an HttpHandler.
Therefore, you should keep this rule,
to prevent ASP.NET MVC from trying to handle the request
instead of letting the dedicated HttpHandler do it.
2.2.
trace.axd
Reference:
https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/wwh16c6c.aspx
trace.axd trace details for a specific request.
If you want to enable trace.axd,
then you have to go to Web.config
Add <trace enabled="true" pageOutput="false"/> under <system.web>
Then run the project, type the following URL
http://localhost/OnlineGame.Web/trace.axd
This will return ASP.NET trace, trace.axd.
If you do not have
// routes.IgnoreRoute("{resource}.axd/{*pathInfo}");
then you can not enable the trace.axd.
